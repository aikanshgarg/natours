/* Ctrl+D: select multiple

- Every CSS property must have a value


- clip path
- centering an element with transform: translate(-50%, -50%) property;
- absolute position always finds the first parent element with position relative as it's reference

- Cascading: resolving final property from multiple definitions

- 'rem' unit is always wrt root font size (default is 16px, i.e., 1rem = 16px). Useful for responsive design as we can just change the root font size and changes will reflect 	   all over the code.

	* Always put your own css file after 3rd party stylesheets to over ride them (order of selectors)
	* We do address accessibility to a degree. For instance, we use percentage instead of px when defining the root font-size, so as not to interfere with custom user settings
	  concerning font-size, allowing visually impaired individuals, or those who simply wish to avoid eye-strain, to retain their higher browser font-size settings.
